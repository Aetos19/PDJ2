# The difference is, however, a package like TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency.

# We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs.

# We can even distribute computations across a distributed network of computers with TensorFlow. 

	x1 = tf.constant(5)
	x2 = tf.constant(6)

	result = tf.nultiply(x1, x2)

	# that the output is just an abstract tensor still. 
	print(result) >> Tensor("Mul:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)

	# To actually see the result, we need to run the session	
	sess = tf.Session()
	print(sess.run(result))

	# you need to close it in order to free up the resources that were used:
	sess.close()
